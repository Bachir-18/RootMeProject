# RootMeProject

The report focuses on understanding and exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in application binaries.  

Key highlights include:  

1. Introduction: Overview of the Root Me challenges aimed at helping users understand application vulnerabilities related to programming errors and memory corruption.  
2. Challenge Walkthroughs: The report covers 18 challenges, each focused on a different type of vulnerability:  
        -Stack Buffer Overflows (e.g., Stack buffer overflow basic 1-6, PIE) where inputs overwrite memory buffers.  
        -Format String Bugs (challenges 9, 10, 18) which exploit improper handling of user input in printf functions.  
        -Use After Free and Double Free challenges, where incorrect memory management leads to exploitable conditions.  
        -Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and ret2dl_resolve, advanced techniques that bypass modern security protections like ASLR and non-executable stacks.  
        -Race Condition challenge which explores the timing issues in file handling.  
3. Methodology: Each challenge follows a structured format:
        -Program Analysis: Review of the code or binary to identify vulnerabilities.  
        -Exploitation Techniques: Step-by-step explanation of how to leverage the vulnerability to achieve system compromise, often using tools like GDB, Python, and custom scripts.  
4. Conclusion: Reflections on the diversity of vulnerabilities encountered and the exploitation methods used to overcome them, emphasizing the depth of technical skill required for each challenge.  

This report serves as a comprehensive guide to tackling real-world-like binary exploitation problems, demonstrating proficiency in areas such as memory corruption, bypassing security mechanisms, and exploiting software bugs.
